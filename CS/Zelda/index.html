    Though she is the eponymous character, Zelda's story role is often that of a damsel in distress or "donor" who assists Link. In many games, Zelda is captured by the antagonist Ganon, necessitating Link to come to her rescue. In several games she is one of the Sages or Champions whose heroism is essential to defeating Ganon; in others, like Ocarina of Time and The Wind Waker, she adopts alternative personas to take a more active role in the story.

  <p>
    Ganon, also known as Ganondorf in his Gerudo form, is a fictional character and the main antagonist of Nintendo's The Legend of Zelda video game series. Ganon is the final boss in many Zelda titles. In the games, the character alternates between two forms: a massive, demonic boar-like creature and a tall, heavily built Gerudo, a race of desert nomad women.
